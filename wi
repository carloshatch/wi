"""WI - Wheel Installer

This is a Python package installer relying on wheels and asyncio with the
sole goal of installing packages as fast as possible while relying as little
as possible on system's config, such as compilers or development packages
(thanks to wheels).

The idea is to enable non-blocking IO operations and take advantage of the
idle time to install already downloaded packages.

However, keep in mind this isn't meant to be a replacement for pip.

If anything, this should help spread the Python Wheels usage and enable
more discussions and work around it.
